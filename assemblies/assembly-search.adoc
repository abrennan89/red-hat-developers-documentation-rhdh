You can configure a search engine for use with {product} that helps users to find the information that they are looking for within the {product-short} ecosystem.

By default, an in-memory search engine implementation built on top of Lunr is provided with your {product-short} instance. {product-short} also supports the use of Elasticsearch.

The {product-short} search provides the following features:
* You can extend search capabilities by creating collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources.
* You can create composable search page experiences.
* You can customize the look and feel of each search result.
