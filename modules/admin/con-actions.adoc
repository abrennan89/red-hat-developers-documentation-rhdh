= Actions

Actions are defined as part of a step in a template. {product} provides some builtin actions that are available for you to use in templates by default, or you can create your own custom actions.

The following example shows how an action can be included as part of a defined step in a template:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: v1beta3-demo
# ...
spec:
# ...
  steps:
    - id: fetch-base
      name: Fetch Base
      action: fetch:template
      input:
        url: ./template
        values:
          name: ${{ parameters.name }}
          owner: ${{ parameters.owner }}
# ...
