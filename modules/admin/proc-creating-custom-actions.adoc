= Creating custom actions

You can create custom actions for your {product} instance that can be used when creating templates.

.Procedure

. Create a new directory inside your backend plugin directory to store your custom actions. The backend plugin directory is usually located at `packages/backend/src/plugins/scaffolder`. Give the new directory a meaningful name, for example `actions`.
. Create a custom action as a TypeScript file in your `actions` directory.
. Register the custom action in your backend plugin, which is usually located at `packages/backend/src/plugins/scaffolder.ts`.
. After saving these changes, rebuild your {product} backend and restart it to apply the new custom action.
. You can now use the custom action in your templates.

.Verification
